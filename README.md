# **IncidentIQ** 🚨
## Multi-Agent AI Platform for DevOps Incident Detection, RCA & Automated Response

IncidentIQ is a production-inspired **multi-agent DevOps incident intelligence platform** that transforms noisy operational logs into:

- Incident detection
- Root cause analysis (RCA)
- Evidence-backed reasoning
- Automated remediation guidance
- Slack/JIRA operational actions
- Human-reviewable incident reports
- AI-generated runbooks and operational cookbooks

Built using **LangGraph**, **LLMs**, **RAG pipelines**, and **deterministic evidence extraction**, IncidentIQ demonstrates how modern AI Agents can automate incident triage and operational response workflows at scale.

# 🧠 What Makes IncidentIQ Different?

Unlike toy AI demos or simple keyword classifiers, IncidentIQ:

- Works on **messy, mixed production-style logs**
- Separates deterministic evidence extraction from LLM reasoning
- Uses **specialized collaborating agents** instead of one monolithic prompt
- Generates **traceable, explainable RCA**
- Uses **RAG-based operational intelligence**
- Prevents unsafe autonomous actions using approval gates
- Simulates realistic enterprise SRE workflows
- Integrates with external operational systems (Slack/JIRA)
